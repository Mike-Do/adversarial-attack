Below is an algorithm that generates adversial examples. It is one of the recent powerful ones that is used as a benchmark to test a model's robustness.

Earlier works propose that existence of adversial examples in neural networks arise since the models do not generalize well, which may be due to their high complexity. However, the following work shows that even linear models are vulnerable. The authors describe a simple method (a.k.a. Fast Gradient Sign Method FGSM) to generate adversial examples, and uses adversial training to reduce error on MNIST classification.
